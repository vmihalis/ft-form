## Integration Notes for AI Assistant

### When Generating Forms

1. **Always include floor context** - If a form relates to a specific floor, use that floor's domain language and relevant field types.

2. **Default to Typeform-style** - One question/section at a time for longer forms, matching FrontierOS's existing UX pattern.

3. **Include floor dropdown** for applications and feedback when floor relevance matters.

4. **Suggest standard FT fields** - Email is always required; consider asking about FT membership status.

5. **Match premium aesthetic** - Language should feel polished but warm, avoiding bureaucratic tone.

### Floor Selection Options

When generating floor dropdowns, use these exact values for compatibility:

```
floor-4: Floor 4 - Robotics & Hard Tech
floor-5: Floor 5 - Movement Floor & Fitness Center
floor-6: Floor 6 - Arts & Music
floor-7: Floor 7 - Frontier Maker Space
floor-8: Floor 8 - Neuro & Biotech
floor-9: Floor 9 - AI & Autonomous Systems
floor-10: Floor 10 - Frontier @ Accelerate
floor-11: Floor 11 - Health & Longevity
floor-12: Floor 12 - Ethereum & Decentralized Tech
