**Score:** 9/9 connections verified

## E2E Flow Verification

| Flow | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Admin edits field → saved → history created → displays in timeline | ✓ Complete |
| 2 | Multiple edits → all show in timeline ordered newest first | ✓ Complete |
| 3 | No-op edit (same value) → no history record created | ✓ Complete |
| 4 | Invalid edit (bad email) → validation blocks → no history | ✓ Complete |

**Score:** 4/4 flows complete

## Field Coverage

All 19 application fields are editable inline:

**Applicant Info (5):** fullName, email, linkedIn, role, bio
**Proposal (7):** floor, initiativeName, tagline, values, targetCommunity, estimatedSize, additionalNotes
**Roadmap (3):** phase1Mvp, phase2Expansion, phase3LongTerm
**Impact (1):** benefitToFT
**Logistics (3):** existingCommunity, spaceNeeds, startDate

## Anti-Patterns

No blocking issues found across all phases:
- No TODO/FIXME comments in new code
- No stub implementations
- No placeholder text
- No console.log-only functions

## Artifacts Created

| File | Lines | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| convex/schema.ts (modified) | +9 | editHistory table definition |
| convex/applications.ts (modified) | +55 | updateField mutation, getEditHistory query |
| src/components/admin/EditableField.tsx | 307 | Reusable inline editing component |
| src/components/admin/EditHistory.tsx | 83 | Collapsible edit history timeline |
| src/components/ui/collapsible.tsx | 8 | Radix Collapsible wrapper |
| src/lib/constants/fieldLabels.ts | 40 | Field name to label mapping |
| src/lib/constants/estimatedSizes.ts | 22 | Estimated size options and labels |
| src/components/admin/ApplicationSheet.tsx (modified) | ~100 | Integration of EditableField for all 19 fields |

## Notes

**Status changes not tracked in edit history:** The StatusDropdown component uses a separate `updateStatus` mutation, so status changes (pending → reviewing → approved/rejected) are not recorded in the edit history. This is by design — the milestone scope focused on form field editing, not status workflows.

## Conclusion

Milestone v1.1 Admin Inline Editing is **complete** with all requirements satisfied, all phases verified, and all integrations working end-to-end. The admin can now:

1. Click any of the 19 form fields to edit inline
2. See visual feedback (pencil icon on hover, edit state border)
3. Save with blur/Enter, cancel with Escape
4. Get validation errors for invalid input
5. View complete edit history in a collapsible timeline
6. See human-readable field names and properly formatted values
