# v1.2 Dynamic Form Builder - Milestone Audit Report

**Milestone Goal:** Enable admins to create and customize application forms with full control over fields, types, and structure. Multiple forms with unique URLs, form versioning for data integrity, and rich field types including file uploads.

**Audited:** 2026-01-29T04:15:00Z

**Status:** PASSED

## Executive Summary

All 27 v1.2 requirements satisfied. All 5 phases verified with 100% must-have coverage. All 34 cross-phase exports properly wired. All 4 E2E user flows complete without breaks. No blocking issues. 3 orphaned exports identified as intentional future utilities.

                       Phase 15 (Admin)
```

All dependency links verified:
- Phase 12 uses Phase 11 schema types
- Phase 13 uses Phase 11 APIs + Phase 12 FileField
- Phase 14 uses Phase 11 APIs + Phase 13 DynamicField for preview
- Phase 15 uses Phase 11 APIs + Phase 14 FormsList + Phase 13-style field rendering

## E2E Flow Verification

### Flow 1: Form Creation
**Path:** /admin/forms/new → builder → publish
**Status:** COMPLETE

1. FormsList renders "New Form" button
2. Form submission calls `api.forms.create`
3. Redirect to `/admin/forms/[formId]`
4. FormBuilderWrapper loads form via `api.forms.getById`
5. FieldPalette + FormCanvas + PropertyPanel render
6. Publish calls `api.forms.publish` → creates version snapshot

### Flow 2: Public Form Submission
**Path:** /apply/[slug] → fill → upload → submit
**Status:** COMPLETE

1. DynamicFormPage calls `api.forms.getBySlug`
2. DynamicFormRenderer renders field components
3. FileField uses useFileUpload → `api.storage.generateUploadUrl`
4. Submit calls `api.submissions.submit` with formVersionId

### Flow 3: Admin Submission Review
**Path:** Submissions tab → filter → detail → edit
**Status:** COMPLETE

1. SubmissionsTable calls `api.submissions.list`
2. FormFilter calls `api.forms.list`
3. Row click opens SubmissionSheet
4. SubmissionSheet calls `api.submissions.getWithSchema`
5. DynamicEditableField calls `api.submissions.updateField`
6. SubmissionEditHistory calls `api.submissions.getEditHistory`

### Flow 4: Form Duplication
**Path:** FormsList → duplicate → edit copy → publish
**Status:** COMPLETE

1. FormsList duplicate button calls `api.forms.duplicate`
2. Backend generates unique slug with collision handling
3. Redirect to `/admin/forms/[newFormId]`
4. Builder loads duplicated form

## Tech Debt

### Non-Critical Items

**Phase 12:**
- `storage.deleteFile` - Exported but unused (future file cleanup)
- `storage.getFileMetadata` - Exported but unused (future metadata display)

**Phase 11:**
- `forms.listVersions` - Exported but unused (future version history UI)

**Impact:** Low. These are intentional utilities for future features, not integration gaps.

### Anti-Patterns

No blocking anti-patterns detected across all 5 phases:
- No TODO/FIXME comments indicating incomplete work
- No stub implementations
- No placeholder content (except legitimate HTML placeholders)
- All components have substantive implementations

## Human Verification Recommendations

While all automated checks pass, the following UX items are recommended for human verification:

1. **Drag-and-drop feel** - Verify activation distance and visual feedback
2. **File upload progress** - Verify progress bar animation and timing
3. **Multi-step navigation** - Verify Back/Next validation behavior
4. **Mobile responsiveness** - Verify builder and forms on mobile devices
5. **Error messages** - Verify validation error display and wording

## Conclusion

**Milestone v1.2 Dynamic Form Builder: PASSED**

All requirements satisfied. All phases verified. All integrations wired. All E2E flows complete. Minimal tech debt (3 intentional future utilities). Ready for production deployment.
