- [x] **SCHEMA-02**: Form versions are immutable snapshots preserving structure at publish time
- [x] **SCHEMA-03**: Submissions reference the form version they were submitted against
- [x] **SCHEMA-04**: Dynamic submissions table stores responses as flexible JSON with formVersionId
- [x] **SCHEMA-05**: Legacy applications coexist with new dynamic submissions

### Field Types

- [x] **FIELD-01**: Text field type with label, placeholder, required flag, and help text
- [x] **FIELD-02**: Textarea field type for multi-line text input

### Form Builder

- [x] **BUILD-04**: Admin can configure field properties (label, placeholder, required, help text)
- [x] **BUILD-05**: Admin can remove fields from form
- [x] **BUILD-06**: Real-time preview shows form as users will see it
- [x] **BUILD-07**: Form has status lifecycle: draft, published, archived
- [x] **BUILD-08**: Publishing creates immutable form version snapshot

### Public Form

- [x] **PUBLIC-01**: Each form accessible at unique URL /apply/[slug]
- [x] **PUBLIC-02**: Dynamic form renderer displays fields based on form schema
- [x] **PUBLIC-03**: Typeform-style step-by-step UX preserved for dynamic forms
- [x] **PUBLIC-04**: Form validation based on field configuration (required, format)

## Future Requirements (v1.3+)

### Deferred from v1.2

- **COND-01**: Conditional logic — show/hide fields based on other field values
- **COND-02**: Field branching — skip to different steps based on answers
- **MULTI-01**: Multi-column field layouts
- **TEMPL-01**: Field templates library for common field patterns
- **COLLAB-01**: Collaborative form editing with conflict resolution
- **ANAL-01**: Form analytics (completion rates, drop-off points)

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded from v1.2. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Conditional logic/branching | Adds 30%+ complexity, explicitly deferred per PROJECT.md |
| Rich text editor for fields | Overkill, complicates storage and rendering |
| Form embedding (iframe/widget) | Unique URLs sufficient for current needs |
| A/B testing | Significant complexity for minimal value |
| Payment fields | Not needed for floor lead applications |
| Multi-language forms | English only, consistent with v1.0 decision |
