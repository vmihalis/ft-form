# Milestone v1.3: Unification & Admin Productivity

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-01-29
**Phases:** 16-19
**Total Plans:** 8

## Overview

Unify the legacy applications system with the dynamic submissions system, and add admin productivity features. This milestone consolidated the codebase under a single dynamic form system and enhanced the admin experience with export, stats, and collaboration tools.

## Phases

### Phase 16: Form Migration

**Goal:** Legacy /apply form is replaced by an equivalent dynamic form.
**Depends on:** None (uses existing dynamic form infrastructure from v1.2)
**Plans:** 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 16-01: Create Floor Lead Application form and update /apply route

**Details:**
- Created Floor Lead Application form with 19 fields across 5 steps
- Seed script for reproducible form creation
- /apply route now serves DynamicFormPage with slug="floor-lead"

### Phase 17: Legacy Cleanup

**Goal:** Codebase is unified under the dynamic form system with no legacy application code.
**Depends on:** Phase 16
**Plans:** 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 17-01: Remove Applications tab from admin dashboard
- [x] 17-02: Delete all legacy application code and Convex tables

**Details:**
- Removed legacy application state from AdminDashboard
- Deleted 26 legacy files (admin components, form directory, Convex backend)
- Simplified schema from 6 to 4 tables (forms, formVersions, submissions, submissionEditHistory)
- FileField relocated to dynamic-form/fields/ (shared dependency)

### Phase 18: Export

**Goal:** Admins can export submission data for external analysis.
**Depends on:** None
**Plans:** 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 18-01: Create CSV utility and add status/date range filters
- [x] 18-02: Add export button with schema-driven CSV headers

**Details:**
- RFC 4180-compliant CSV export with UTF-8 BOM for Excel compatibility
- StatusFilter and DateRangeFilter components
- Export respects all active filters (form, status, date range, search)
- Schema-driven headers from form field labels

### Phase 19: Dashboard Enhancement

**Goal:** Admin dashboard provides at-a-glance insights and collaboration tools.
**Depends on:** None
**Plans:** 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 19-01: Stats cards with submission counts by status
- [x] 19-02: Activity feed with recent submissions
- [x] 19-03: Internal notes on submissions

**Details:**
- DashboardStats with 5 stat cards (Total, New, Under Review, Accepted, Rejected)
- ActivityFeed with real-time recent submissions, submitter name extraction
- NotesEditor with save-on-blur pattern, visual feedback states
- Dashboard tab as new default admin view

## Milestone Summary

**Decimal Phases:** None

**Key Decisions:**
- Submissions became default admin tab (was Applications, now Dashboard)
- CSV utility uses pure JS/browser APIs (no external dependencies)
- Export takes submission IDs from filtered table rows (ensures exact match with UI)
- Dashboard shows stats above all tabs, activity feed in Dashboard tab
- Notes use save-on-blur pattern (no edit history - internal drafts)
- Date range filter includes full end day (23:59:59.999)
- Submitter name extracted from data fields containing "name" (excluding email)
- Simple relative time function used (no date-fns dependency)

**Issues Resolved:**
- Legacy code duplication eliminated (single form system)
- Admin couldn't export data → CSV export with filtering
- No overview of submissions → Dashboard stats and activity feed
- No way to annotate submissions → Internal notes feature

**Issues Deferred:**
- Status change tracking in activity feed (deferred to v1.4+)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- StatusBadge.tsx orphaned (replaced by inline badge rendering) - non-blocking
