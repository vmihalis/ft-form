    Form Polish and Animations:
    1. Brand purple (#7b42e7) applied to all primary UI elements
    2. Smooth slide + fade transitions between all 8 form steps
    3. Direction-aware animations (forward slides left, back slides right)
    4. Automatic reduced motion support for accessibility
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    1. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
    2. Visit http://localhost:3000/apply

    **Check Brand Colors:**
    - [ ] "Begin Application" button is purple (not gray)
    - [ ] Progress indicator steps are purple when active/complete
    - [ ] Focus rings on inputs are purple
    - [ ] Loading spinner (refresh page) is purple

    **Check Animations:**
    - [ ] Click "Begin Application" - Welcome slides out left, step 1 slides in from right
    - [ ] Click "Continue" through each step - smooth left slide each time
    - [ ] Click "Back" - content slides right (opposite direction)
    - [ ] Transitions feel smooth, not janky (approx 300ms duration)
    - [ ] No layout shifts (navigation buttons stay in place)

    **Check Reduced Motion (optional but recommended):**
    - Enable "Reduce motion" in your OS accessibility settings
    - Refresh page and navigate steps
    - [ ] Transitions should be instant (no slide animation)

    **Overall Feel:**
    - [ ] Does the form feel "Typeform-style" - minimal, modern, premium?
    - [ ] Are animations enhancing UX or distracting?
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>
    Type "approved" if all checks pass.
    If issues found, describe what needs adjustment.

2. Form uses brand colors (#7b42e7 purple and white) throughout
3. Users with prefers-reduced-motion see instant transitions
4. Visual design feels minimal, modern, and premium
